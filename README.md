# Employee_Attrition_Analysis


## Project Background
Employee attrition is a significant concern for any company. Understanding the reasons behind why employees are leaving can help us develop effective strategies to retain our talent. This report analyzes various factors contributing to employee attrition and provides actionable insights to reduce the attrition rate.


Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- **Job Satisfaction**:  Analysis of employee satisfaction levels and their impact on attrition rates.
- **Work-Life Balance Evaluation:**  Assessment of work-life balance ratings and their influence on employee well-being and retention.
- **Career Growth Patterns:**  Examination of promotion timelines in relation to employee tenure and its effect on long-term engagement.


The Jupyter Notebook used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found here [link].

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore trends can be found here [link].


# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

The analysis reveals that job dissatisfaction, particularly around work-life balance and limited promotions, is linked to higher attrition. Employees with lower satisfaction ratings are more likely to leave, and most employees feel their work-life balance is moderate, not ideal. Additionally, a positive correlation between tenure and time since the last promotion suggests that long-serving employees may be experiencing slower career growth, which could further impact retention.

# Insights Deep Dive
### Job Satisfaction:

* A total of 699 employees were surveyed for job satisfaction, with a majority (215 employees) rating their satisfaction as a 3 on a scale of 1 to 4. This suggests that most employees feel moderately satisfied with their jobs, though they are not fully content.
  
*  Employees who rated their job satisfaction as 1 (the lowest) or 2 make up 331 individuals, indicating a significant portion of the workforce may be at risk of attrition due to dissatisfaction. These employees represent nearly half of the total workforce surveyed.
  
*  Only 153 employees gave a job satisfaction rating of 4 (the highest), showing that highly satisfied employees make up a relatively small portion of the company. This highlights a potential area for improvement in boosting overall employee satisfaction.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
